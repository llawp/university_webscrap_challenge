# World University Webscrapping Challenge


I was asked by to help gathering a large amount of data for R&D purpose. The issue is that there’s no easily accessible, ready to pick data from the company’s internal database. You need to gather the data by your own, from the net. She requires data of all universities around the world (not just Indonesia) and the university’s country location. Each data
record should at least consisted of 2 field: “name of university”, “country location” (Additional data fields aside from those 2 are welcome)
